## INTRODUCTION OF THE PROJECT

In merely a decade, youth-oriented cafe culture, primarily that of college students, has metamorphosed from casual social interaction into a statement of lifestyle, entrepreneurship, and community involvement. This change is even more evident in academic settings such as the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), where cafes basically serve as meeting points for students and entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, many of these cafe enterprises are still plagued with the very common problems of manual order processing, irregular inventory control, and a lack of service area integration.

This project seeks to tackle the discovered inefficiencies by creating a cafe management system based on Laravel technology, provisionally referred to as **CafeConnect**. The proposed solution will help student entrepreneurs, startup cafe owners, and campus vendors improve backend processes and customer service using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture that Laravel is based on.

The system will provide:
- A centralized online platform to manage menus and process orders.
- Basic inventory management to track ingredients to ensure items are not understocked or overstocked.
- A role-based authentication system for various types of employees and café owners.
- A user interaction module that tracks simple input from customers.

The goal of this project by our team is to assist by:
- Using effective and safe digital technologies to modernize small & medium-sized cafes.
- Encouraging university students to engage in business activities in an Islamic context.
- Providing a management tool that is easy to use and abides by moral and corporate regulations.

This Laravel web application will try to close a technical gap that is often overlooked by providing a functional, relevant, and contextual response that represents the real-life operating conditions that IIUM students and other young cafe owners will encounter.

## OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT 

This project aims to provide a meaningful and ethical digital solution to the evolving cafe market, particularly for those initiated or managed by student entrepreneurs within university environments such as IIUM. This Laravel application is designed to improve business management while supporting the personal and professional development of young operators to lead the way in the marketplace and respond to the need for systems that are efficient, secure, and compliant with Shariah.

The main objectives are:
- To design and build a modular web-based application to effectively manage the operations of a cafe utilizing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural design pattern in Laravel. This includes processing ingredients to make ordered drinks, inventory management, the ability to change menu items, and easy customer-facing interactions.
  
- To motivate undergraduate students to pursue responsible digital entrepreneurship by integrating role-based access control, structured processes, and ethical business conduct into an accessible and educational system framework.

- To provide a platform that is scalable and contextualized to assist small to medium-sized cafe enterprises—particularly campus-based ones—enabling them to upgrade using a solution that maintains Islamic values and improves quality of service and sustainability in the long run.
